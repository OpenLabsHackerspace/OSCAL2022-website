            The <a href="https://events.opensuse.org/" target="_blank">openSUSE Summit at OSCAL 2022</a> 
            will take place on one day of OSCAL and people are encouraged to submit a talk about openSUSE 
            and open source. There are two talks that can be submitted for the summit. One is a short talk
