Every year, an enthusiastic band of volunteers helps us make OSCAL a fun and safe place for all our attendees. We could not do this without you. This year we need again as many hands as possible, especially during the build up (starting Friday at noon) and 16-17 May. A considerable part of the success of an event is because of the team that **makes** it possible. If you want to be part of the success, please  join us as a volunteer. **It is something that needs dedication, but we believe it pays up in friendships and eternal gratitude.**

If you have some spare time during the week (May 2020) and would like to be a part of the team that makes OSCAL tick, please APPLY below:

##### **Responsibilities:**
Volunteers help with all kinds of activities during the event: Registration of participants, assisting speakers and participants, keeping social media channels up to date, taking photos for twitter, facebook, distributing information at the event etc. We will have at least 2 meetings to explain in details your responsibilities.

##### **Perks:**
You will get to hang out with a cool and crazy bunch of people from all over Europe (if not the world), experience things from behind the stage and be part of one of our after parties with our speakers!

##### **What we cannot provide:**  
Due to our limited budget, we cannot sponsor your travel or accomodation, in case you are coming outside Tirana. Further, we do not provide certificates or similar related to the conference, sorry.  
Thank you in advance for the love!
