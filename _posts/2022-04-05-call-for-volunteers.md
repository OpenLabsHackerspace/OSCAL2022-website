Did you know that internet was built on open source software?
And not only, but Linux, Mozilla, VLC Media player and Python (yes, the programming language) are only a few software from the Open Source World.

For the 7th time, Open Source Conference Albania (OSCAL) is back in Tirana during the weekend of June 18-19.
Whether you are an open source software contributor or totally clueless - but you would like to use your skills and time to bring OSCAL to life - we have a place for you.

Volunteers help with all kind of activities during the event: registration of participants, assisting speakers and participants, keeping social media channels up to date, taking photos for social media, distributing information at the event etc.

As a volunteer you are going to work closely with the small organizing team, which will guide and assist you during your tasks if you need any help. There will also be at least two meetings to introduce you to the cool tasks so you can pick the role that you like best.

You can dedicate to the conference as much volunteering time as you want, be it a couple of hours or the whole weekend which means that you will miss some of the workshops or presentations during the event (as a multi-track conference, this is inevitable anyway).
