On March 12th the [World Health Organization](http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/3/who-announces-covid-19-outbreak-a-pandemic) declared the outbreak of [CoronaVirus (COVID-19)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) as global pandemic. Our only concerned at this moment is everyone's health and as a result we regret to announce that **the 7th edition of Open Source Conference Albania (OSCAL) will be postponed**. Unfortunately, OSCAL cannot be held on May 16-17 2020 as these days are within the period experts expect the pandemic not to has been fade yet. A few days ago, Wikimedia Hackathon 2020 which was planned originally to be held a weekend prior to OSCAL in Tirana was cancelled as well as a result of COVID-19 outbreak.

**The new dates will be announced in the upcoming months** while we will follow closely the experts' decisions. We understand that this might bring inconveniences to everyone who has applied for a session and you will be notified via email with all the updates.
