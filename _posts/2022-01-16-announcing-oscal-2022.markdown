We are delighted to announce that we are bringing OSCAL back on the weekend of **18-19th of June 2022**.

**OSCAL (Open Source Conference Albania)** is the first annual conference in Albania organized to promote software freedom, open source software, free culture and open knowledge. The Conference will gather free libre open source technology users, developers, academics, governmental agencies and people who share the idea that software should be free and open for the local community and governments to develop and customize to its needs; that knowledge is a communal property and free and open to everyone.

This is the **7th edition of the conference**. Unfortunately, we had to cancel the edition for 2020 because of the pandemic, but we are looking forward to this edition to bring again together floss friends from different communities.

Further details and calls for participation will be announced in the coming weeks. Stay tuned! As always you can follow us on our social media:
