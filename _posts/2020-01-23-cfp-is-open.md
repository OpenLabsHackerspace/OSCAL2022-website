Now, we are calling for proposals (CFP), we would like to invite developers, speakers and promoters from Albania, the region and overseas to submit proposals. The applicants for who want to pitch at OSCAL’20 must be aware that the topic MUST be related with open knowledge, open source software and/or hardware, software freedom, online privacy or generally open culture. We accept talks and workshops (applicants are encouraged to bring their own laptops).

While we will most likely be having a working internet connection at the venue, please don’t rely your session solely on the wifi if possible. In this way we can prevent unneeded technical disasters.

Almost all sessions will be held in English. Proposals should also be submitted in English. You are free to propose more than one session, in a separate submission.

##### This year theme is: Internet Freedom FTW
For years, netizens have praised the collaborative tools empowered from the internet and the decentralized character of the network of networks. At the same time, hacktivists and whistle-blowers have warned us about the raising interest in controlling, filtering and censoring the internet as we know it.

Unfortunately, our biggest fears are becoming a reality. We read more and more reports about net neutrality being lost, massive surveillance operations being conducted, domain names being blocked, news outlets being censored and governments are fighting tools like encryption. A disturbing phenomena happening in Albania, the Balkans and also worldwide. The World Wide Web, an amazing tool used to share knowledge, information and one of the fastest communication tools is now being used against us and we need to act!

Deadline for submission is 1st of April.

Keep in mind this year dates are 16-17 of May. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact the team at email: [oscal(at)openlabs.cc](mailto:oscal@openlabs.cc)
